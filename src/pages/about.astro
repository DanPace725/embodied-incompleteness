        A celebration of the neurodivergent creative process and the beauty of unfinished projects.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-white">What is this?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The Embodied Incompleteness Theorem is a digital archive of my creative journey - a collection 
        of projects in various states of completion. As someone with ADHD/ASD, my brain operates in ways 
        that don't always align with conventional expectations of linearity and completion.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Rather than viewing my collection of unfinished projects as failures, this space reframes them 
        as a constellation of valuable experiences, skills gained, and creative explorations.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-white">Project States</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Instead of the binary "finished/unfinished," projects here exist in more nuanced states:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="space-y-3 mt-4 text-gray-300">
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-green-500 mt-1.5 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span><strong class="text-white">Actively Exploring</strong> - Currently being worked on with some regularity</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-blue-500 mt-1.5 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span><strong class="text-white">Peacefully Resting</strong> - On pause but may return to someday</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-purple-500 mt-1.5 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span><strong class="text-white">Harvested for Parts</strong> - Abandoned but with valuable pieces repurposed elsewhere</span>

          <span class="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-yellow-500 mt-1.5 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>

          <span class="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-indigo-500 mt-1.5 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>

        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-teal-500 mt-1.5 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span><strong class="text-white">Complete Enough</strong> - Taken as far as needed, even if not "finished" by conventional standards</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-pink-500 mt-1.5 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-white">The Constellation Metaphor</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        I've chosen to visualize these projects as a constellation because:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="space-y-3 mt-4 text-gray-300">
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-blue-400 mt-2 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span>Stars exist in relation to one another, just as my projects inform and influence each other</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-blue-400 mt-2 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span>Constellations are patterns we impose on seemingly random points - finding meaning in the chaos</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-blue-400 mt-2 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span>The space between stars is just as important as the stars themselves</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="inline-block w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-blue-400 mt-2 mr-3 flex-shrink-0"></span>
          <span>The view changes depending on your perspective</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-white">Why "Incompleteness Theorem"?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems taught us that no mathematical system can be both complete and consistent. 
        Similarly, I've found that creative pursuits often face a tension between completion and exploration.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        This project embraces the idea that incompleteness isn't a flaw but a feature - a necessary 
        condition for growth, learning, and the kind of unexpected connections that define neurodivergent thinking.
